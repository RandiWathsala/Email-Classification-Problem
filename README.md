# 📧 Email Classification Problem



A machine learning project that classifies Gmail emails into meaningful categories such as Academic, Bills & Finance, News & Updates, Personal, and Official.
This project integrates data collection (from Gmail API), data cleaning, preprocessing, model development, and deployment via Streamlit wrapped in an Electron desktop app.

🚀 Features

-Fetch emails directly from Gmail using the Gmail API

-Data cleaning pipelines (basic and deep cleaning)

-Preprocessing with TF-IDF vectorization

-Multiple ML models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, SVM

-Streamlit web app for interactive classification

-Electron wrapper for cross-platform desktop application

-Ability to mark emails as read directly from the app

🔑 Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Email-Classification-Problem.git
cd Email-Classification-Problem

2. Set up Gmail API

-Go to Google Cloud Console

-Enable Gmail API

-Create OAuth client credentials → download credentials.json

-Place credentials.json in the project root

On first run, you’ll authenticate and generate a token.json for reuse.

3. Python Environment

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # (Linux/Mac)
venv\Scripts\activate      # (Windows)

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Data Collection

Fetch emails from Gmail and save to CSV:
python read.py

Clean them:
python clean.py
python deepclean.py

Preprocess and vectorize:
python preprocessing.py

5. Model Training

Run your training script or notebook to train and evaluate models.
Best model can be saved as .pkl:
import joblib
joblib.dump(best_model, "email_sorting_model.pkl")

6. Run Streamlit App
streamlit run app.py

7. Run Desktop App (Electron)

Install Node.js dependencies:
cd electron
npm install
npm start

To build the desktop app:
npm run build
